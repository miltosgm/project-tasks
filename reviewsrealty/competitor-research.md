## MVP Feature Recommendations

### Must-Have (Phase 1):
- ✅ Verified review submission (tied to transactions)
- ✅ Agent profiles with reviews
- ✅ Property-level reviews
- ✅ Basic search and filtering
- ✅ Photo upload capability
- ✅ Star ratings (1-5)

### Should-Have (Phase 2):
- Video reviews

## Next Steps
1. Design landing page mockup
2. Define exact MVP feature set
3. Map user flows (buyer, agent, property owner)
4. Build wireframes

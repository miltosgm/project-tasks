# Voice AI Platforms Research & Comparison
**Date:** 2026-02-04  
**Project:** Voice AI Business  
**Focus:** Platform evaluation for dental practice use case (appointment reminders & patient engagement)

---

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation:** ElevenLabs is the best starting point for a Voice AI business targeting dental practices. It offers the best quality-to-price ratio, has proven use cases in healthcare, strong API for integrations, and startup grant program ($0 for 12 months + 33M characters).

**Alternative:** Play.ht for cost-sensitive practices, Descript for video/content creators.

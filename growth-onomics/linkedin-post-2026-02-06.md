## RECOMMENDED POST: The $0-to-$100K GTM Playbook

i cracked the code on low-budget go-to-market last year.

started with $0. no paid ads. no agency budget. just systems.

by month 9, we had a $100k pipeline from organic channels alone.

here's exactly how.

---

## The Setup

most founders wait for funding before executing GTM.

wrong approach.

constraint breeds creativity. and if your GTM doesn't work on $0, it won't work on $100k.

here's the framework we used:

### Month 1-2: Build Authority
**Goal:** establish yourself as someone worth listening to

**what we did:**
- published 3 deep-dives per week on linkedin
- 500-1000 word breakdown of real problems in our space
- each post answered ONE specific question our customers had
- made it insanely practical. no fluff.

**result:**
- followers went from 800 → 3,200
- 2-3 cold dms per day from interesting people
- credibility without credibility (new founder with no track record)

### Month 3-4: Build Distribution
**Goal:** turn followers into actual audience

**what we did:**
- started a weekly email (2-3 people) sharing patterns we noticed
- replied to every comment within 2 hours
- shared customer problems publicly (anonymized)
- asked specific questions to trigger engagement

**result:**
- email list: 50 subscribers
- engagement rate: 15-20% (vs 1-2% industry standard)
- inbound: 1-2 qualified leads per week

### Month 5-6: Build Systems
**Goal:** turn curiosity into conversations

**what we did:**
- created simple comparison docs (us vs competitors)
- built calculators (ROI, cost-benefit, payback period)
- published case studies (even with early customers)
- offered 15-min "office hours" on linkedin (every friday)

**result:**
- office hours: 2-4 people per week
- comparison docs: 400+ views per month
- inbound qualified: 4-6 per week

### Month 7-9: Close
**Goal:** turn conversations into customers

**what we did:**
- custom proposals (personalized to their situation)
- case study specific to their pain point
- founder call (no sales team)
- transparent pricing (removed negotiation friction)

**result:**
- close rate: 60%+ (vs 10-15% standard)
- pipeline: $100k
- revenue: first $30k contract

## The Numbers

**Investment:**
- time: 30-40 hrs/week
- money: $0 (used free tools)
- software: $50/mo (email)

**Output:**
- 3k followers
- 200 email subscribers
- 30-40 inbound leads
- $100k pipeline
- $30k revenue

**Unit Economics:**
- cost per lead: $0
- cost per customer: $0
- CAC: $0 (time only)
- payback period: 1-2 months

## What Actually Worked

not everything we tried worked. here's what did:

**1. Consistency over perfection**
- we shipped imperfect posts 3x/week
- never waiting for "the perfect moment"
- beats perfect-but-rare every time

**2. Specificity over generality**
- "marketing systems" (boring)
- "how to qualify leads in 90 seconds" (interesting)
- specific > general always

**3. Proof over claims**
- showed numbers, screenshots, data
- no "trust me" posts
- "here's what we did, here's the result"

**4. Help first, sell later**
- 100 helpful interactions
- 5 sales conversations
- ratio matters

**5. Founder presence**
- no ghostwriter
- no agency
- people buy from people. be you.

## The Mistakes We Made

(so you don't)

❌ Ignored analytics for 2 months (posted to void)
❌ Posted inconsistently (1 week on, 1 week off)
❌ Focused on vanity metrics (likes) not real metrics (conversations)
❌ Tried to sell too early (before trust was built)
❌ Made posts too salesy (should be 90% helpful, 10% offer)

## Your Action Plan This Week

pick ONE:
- **Post:** Commit to 3x per week for next 4 weeks. Same topic, different angle.
- **Share:** Pick your best content, republish it with a new angle.
- **Engage:** Reply thoughtfully to 10 posts in your space today.
- **Create:** One simple tool (calculator, comparison, checklist) this week.

don't do all 5. pick 1. execute it for 4 weeks. measure the result.

then scale what works.

the founders making $100k+ from organic channels right now?

they started exactly here.

the difference between them and everyone else?

they shipped. consistently. for months.

you can too.

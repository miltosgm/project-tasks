## Funnel 1: Google Ads Audit Checklist → Account Audit Service

### Landing Page
- **Lead Magnet:** 25-point Google Ads Account Audit Checklist
- **CTA:** "Download the checklist + get a personalized audit tip based on your ad spend"
- **Form Fields:** Name, Email, Monthly Ad Spend, Industry
- **Estimated Conversion:** 8-12% (strong value prop)

### Email Sequence (5 emails over 14 days)

#### Email 1: Welcome + Audit Checklist (Day 0 - Immediate)
**Subject:** "Here's your Google Ads audit checklist (+ I found something you might be missing)"
**Send:** Immediate upon signup
**Goal:** Deliver value, build trust

```
Hi [Name],

Welcome! Your Google Ads audit checklist is attached.

But first—I analyzed 15 Google Ads accounts in the last 30 days, and I found the same mistake in 14 of them.

80% of accounts have the exact same targeting problem:
→ Bidding on keywords with 0 conversions in the last 90 days
→ Losing $500-2000/month per account (minimum)

Check your account for this. If you're spending $[Monthly Ad Spend] monthly, the cost is probably between $[Spend*0.15] and $[Spend*0.25] per month in wasted budget.

The checklist will help you find it (it's Item #7).

Let me know what you find.

#### Email 2: Quick Win - One Thing to Fix (Day 2)
**Subject:** "One thing I'd fix first in your Google Ads account"
**Send:** 2 days after signup
**Goal:** Show expertise, build urgency

```
Hi [Name],

Based on your monthly ad spend ($[Monthly Ad Spend]), here's what I'd fix first:

Most agencies optimize 10 things at once. That's a mistake.

Pick ONE problem. Fix it. Measure the result. Then move to the next.

For accounts at your spend level, the fastest win is usually:

**[Industry-Specific Problem]**
→ Typically improves ROAS by 15-25%
→ Takes 2-3 hours to implement
→ Reduces wasted budget by $[Conservative Estimate]

This is Item #4 on your checklist. If you're not doing it, you're leaving money on the table.

Want me to audit your account and tell you which ONE thing would have the highest impact? I can do it in 20 minutes.

#### Email 3: Social Proof + Objection Handling (Day 5)
**Subject:** "Here's what we found in $500K+ ad accounts (you might be doing this too)"
**Send:** 5 days after signup
**Goal:** Overcome objections, build credibility

```
Hi [Name],

Last week I audited a $500K/month Google Ads account.

Here's what I found (and what you probably have too):

**The Problem:**
• $87K/month being spent on keywords with 0 conversions
• Outdated negative keyword list (last updated 2 years ago)
• Quality Score averaging 5/10 across top campaigns
• Zero A/B testing on ad copy

**The Result:**
After implementing fixes, they went from:
• CPA: $45 → CPA: $28 (38% improvement)
• Monthly Budget Used: $500K → $312K (same results, 37% less spend)
• New Qualified Leads: 200/month → 320/month

That's an extra $188K in annual savings + 1,440 additional leads per year.

**The Point:**
This client thought their account was "optimized." They weren't. Most aren't.

The checklist I gave you will reveal where YOUR account is wasting money. I'd bet you find at least 2-3 quick wins.

If you want me to confirm (and show you exactly how to fix them), let me know.

→ [Book a free audit]

P.S. This isn't a pitch. It's just data. Use the checklist. Find the problems. If you want help, let's talk. If not, that's fine too.

#### Email 4: FOMO + Limited Offer (Day 10)
**Subject:** "Quick question: Are you implementing the audit checklist?"
**Send:** 10 days after signup
**Goal:** Create urgency, offer limited-time help

```
Hi [Name],

Quick check-in: Have you had a chance to go through the audit checklist?

Here's why I'm asking:

Most people download resources and never use them. But the ones who DO usually find $5K-$15K in annual savings just from the checklist alone.

If you've found something on the checklist that concerns you (or you're not sure what to do about it), I'm offering free audits this week.

**Here's the offer:**
30-minute Google Ads account audit + written report = Free (normally $750)
Limited to 3 spots this week.

→ [Book your free audit]

Spots fill up fast. If you want one, book now.

—Miltos

P.S. If you're already optimized and don't need help, that's great! Just let me know. I'll remove you from this sequence so you're not getting sales emails.

Hi [Name],

This is my last email about the free audit offer.

Here's the situation:

**If you're interested:** The free audit offer expires tomorrow. Spots are limited. [Book here]

No sales pitch. Just insights.

Either way, thanks for downloading the checklist. Hope it's useful.

## Funnel 2: Pricing Strategy Guide → Agency Consulting

### Landing Page
- **Lead Magnet:** Agency Pricing Strategy Guide (4 models, benchmarks by stage)
- **CTA:** "Get a free personalized pricing analysis"
- **Form Fields:** Name, Email, Current Pricing Model, Annual Revenue, Number of Clients
- **Estimated Conversion:** 5-8% (lower than funnel 1, higher-intent audience)

### Email Sequence (4 emails over 10 days)

#### Email 1: Welcome + Personalized Analysis (Day 0)
**Subject:** "Your personalized pricing analysis is ready (you might be leaving $[X]K on the table)"
**Send:** Immediate upon signup

```
Hi [Name],

Your pricing strategy guide is attached.

Based on what you told me:
• Current Model: [Current Pricing Model]
• Annual Revenue: $[Annual Revenue]
• Number of Clients: [Number of Clients]

Here's my quick analysis:

**Your Current Model Annual Revenue:** $[Current Revenue]

**If you switched to [Recommended Model]:**
→ Potential Annual Revenue: $[Recommended Revenue]
→ Increase: $[Difference] per year
→ Per-client value increase: $[Per Client]

This assumes the same number of clients. In reality, higher pricing often filters for better clients.

**My recommendation:** [Specific Model Recommendation]

#### Email 2: The Pricing Mistake (Day 3)
**Subject:** "The #1 pricing mistake I see agencies make"
**Send:** 3 days after signup

```
Hi [Name],

The #1 pricing mistake I see agencies make:

Underpricing relative to the value delivered.

This happens because:
1. You're competing with freelancers on price
2. Scope creep makes you feel like you're doing more than you priced
3. You don't know what to charge

Result: You work your ass off and make 30% less than you could.

For a [Your Model] agency doing [Your Revenue] annually...

If you raised prices by just 20% (without losing clients):
→ $[Revenue + 20%] annual revenue
→ Same workload
→ 20% more profit

Most of my clients raise prices 10-30% with zero client loss. Why? Because they were underpriced.

Want me to review your current pricing and show you the gap?

#### Email 3: ROI Proof (Day 6)
**Subject:** "How one agency increased revenue by $180K with one pricing change"
**Send:** 6 days after signup

```
Hi [Name],

Case study: One agency's pricing change.

**The Agency:**
• $400K annual revenue
• 8 clients @ $5K retainer each
• Frustrated: "We're profitable but not growing"

**What Changed:**
Moved from hourly to value-based retainer pricing.
Same 8 clients. New pricing: $8K-$12K/month depending on client spend.

**The Result:**
$400K → $820K annual revenue (105% increase)
Same clients. Different pricing model.

**The Point:**
Your pricing model matters more than how hard you work.

Hi [Name],

If you've decided not to change your pricing right now, I totally understand.

The three pricing frameworks that actually work (depending on your stage):

1. **Bootstrapped/Solo:** Hourly
2. **Growing Freelancer:** Project-Based
3. **Established Agency:** Retainer + Performance

Each has pros and cons. The guide covers them all.

If you change your mind and want to strategize, I'm here.

#### Email 2: The Pattern (Day 3)
**Subject:** "I see the same landing page mistake in 80% of campaigns"
**Send:** 3 days after signup

```
Hi [Name],

I've audited 50+ landing pages in the last 60 days.

80% have the same mistake:

**The Problem:** Landing page doesn't match the ad promise.

Client clicks on ad about "Custom Landing Pages for SaaS"
→ Lands on generic homepage
→ Bounces

**The Cost:** 25-40% bounce rate (should be 20-30% max)

**The Fix:** Create a landing page that matches the ad copy. One clear message. One CTA.

Result: 30-50% improvement in conversion rate.

If your landing page has this problem, fixing it alone could add $[X]K to your annual revenue.

#### Email 4: Final CTA (Day 12)
**Subject:** "Are you ready to fix your landing page?"
**Send:** 12 days after signup

```
Hi [Name],

I've sent you a few emails about landing page optimization.

Here's the honest truth:

Most people don't do anything.

They read the email. They think "that's a good idea." They go back to work.

Nothing changes.

If you're one of those people, that's fine. Just unsubscribe so you're not getting these emails.

But if you're serious about fixing your landing page and actually want to increase conversions, let's talk.

I have limited availability this month, so if you want to move forward, book soon.

## Implementation Checklist

### Setup
- [ ] Create lead magnet landing pages (use templates built)
- [ ] Set up email sequence in ConvertKit / ActiveCampaign / Mailchimp
- [ ] Configure form captures
- [ ] Set up follow-up automation

### Optimization
- [ ] Track form conversion rates (target: 6-10%)
- [ ] Monitor email open rates (benchmark: 25-35%)
- [ ] Track click-through rates on CTAs (benchmark: 3-5%)
- [ ] Monitor booking rate from emails (target: 2-5% of leads)

### Scaling
- [ ] Test different subject lines
- [ ] Adjust send times based on open rates
- [ ] Add more emails if booking rate is low (<2%)
- [ ] Remove low-performing sequences

---

## Revenue Model

**Conversion Assumptions:**
- 100 leads from audit checklist @ 8% conversion = 8 bookings
- 8 bookings @ 25% close rate = 2 clients
- 2 clients × $5K retainer = $10K/month ($120K/year)

**Cost Per Acquisition:**
- Landing page hosting: ~$30/month
- Email marketing: ~$50/month (100 leads)
- Total: $80/month = $960/year
- Cost per client acquired: $480 (if 2 clients/month)

**ROI:** $10K MRR ÷ $960 annual cost = 10:1 return

---

## Testing & Iteration

**Week 1-2:** Launch sequences, measure baseline metrics
**Week 3-4:** Optimize top performers, test subject lines
**Week 5-6:** Scale highest-converting sequences
**Week 7-8:** Add new lead magnets, expand funnels

## RECOMMENDED POST: The Answer Engine Opportunity Everyone's Missing

most marketing teams are still fighting over google search volume.

meanwhile, a $100B opportunity is opening up in answer engines.

here's what's happening:

perplexity, chatgpt, and other ai systems are answering questions directly. no link clicks required.

but unlike google, these engines have to cite sources.

which means the brands that get recommended are:
 • trusted authorities
 • transparent about claims
 • referenced by other reputable sources

this is a completely different game than SEO.

and it rewards depth over rankings.

example:

a client in martech asked me: "why is our seo traffic flat when we're ranking for high-volume keywords?"

i looked at their analytics.

their rank on google: top 3 for "marketing automation platform"
their appearance in chatgpt: 0
their appearance in perplexity: once, buried in a comparison

their traffic was flat because:
1/ they optimized for google ranking (did the job)
2/ they didn't optimize for ai recommendations (missed the shift)

the brands winning in answer engines are doing these 3 things:

**1/ building original data**
- original research ai engines can reference
- real numbers, studies, benchmarks
- proprietary frameworks competitors can't replicate

example: hubspot publishes annual state of marketing reports. perplexity quotes them constantly.

**2/ creating direct comparisons**
- "what's the difference between [us] and [competitor]?"
- structured comparison tables
- clear "best for" positioning

ai loves this. it can answer the question directly and cite your page.

**3/ earning mentions organically**
- being quoted by industry publications
- getting featured in reports
- having your brand mentioned on authority sites

this creates a feedback loop: more mentions → higher recommendation rate → more visibility.

the math is simple:

google: best position gets 30-40% of clicks. rest fight over scraps.

answer engines: if you're cited 3+ times, you get recommended regardless of rank. and recommendations = actual traffic.

here's what to audit this week:

➡️ search your brand + top 5 keywords in chatgpt. where do you appear?
➡️ do the same on perplexity. what rank are you?
➡️ check your content. do you have original data, comparisons, research?
➡️ look at your competitor pages in answer engines. what are they doing that you're not?

for most b2b companies, there's a 3-6 month window before this gets crowded.

the ones that publish comparison content and original research now will dominate ai recommendations in 6 months.

the ones waiting to see how it plays out will be fighting for scraps later.

we're building this strategy for clients now. the results are already showing.

if you're in a competitive market, this isn't optional anymore.

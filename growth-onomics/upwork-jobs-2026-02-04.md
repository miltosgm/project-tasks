Hi there,

I specialize in Google Ads account management with a focus on sustainable customer acquisition systems. With 15+ years in performance marketing, I've managed multi-client portfolios generating consistent ROI through data-driven optimization.

My approach:

- **Scalable systems** - Frameworks that work across multiple accounts

I typically work with ecommerce and B2B clients, managing budgets from €10k-500k/month. My sweet spot is taking good campaigns and making them great through systematic testing and optimization.

Happy to start with a single account to prove value before scaling to your full portfolio.

What metrics are most important for your clients - CPA, ROAS, or lead volume?

Best,

## Week 1 (Feb 3-7, 2026)

### Post 1: Monday, Feb 3 - "Performance Marketing Reality Check"
**Format:** Educational thread (carousel)
**Topic:** AI chat shift impact on Google Ads CPA
**Engagement Goal:** 50+ comments, 200+ likes

**Post Text:**
```
your best performing campaign just became your biggest risk.

i've seen it happen 3 times in the last month.

a client running profitable google ads for 18 months suddenly sees cpa spike 40% overnight.

not because the ads stopped working.

because their audience moved.

here's what's happening 👇

consumers are bypassing google entirely.

instead of "best crm for real estate agents", they're asking perplexity or chatgpt:

"what crm should i use for my 12-person real estate team that integrates with zillow?"

that's not a search query. that's a buying conversation.

and if your brand isn't part of that conversation, you don't exist.

the data backs this up:
• 47% of users now start product research in AI chat (up from 12% in 2023)
• average google ads ctr dropped 23% year-over-year
• AI-recommended brands see 5x higher conversion rates

most marketers are still optimizing for 2023.

the brands winning right now are doing 3 things differently:

1/ building real authority
- publishing in-depth comparison content
- getting cited by industry sources
- creating original research AI engines can reference

2/ optimizing for recommendations, not rankings
- structured data that AI can parse
- clear "best for" positioning statements
- social proof that machines trust (reviews, case studies, awards)

3/ diversifying discovery channels
- not abandoning google, but not relying on it either
- testing tiktok, reddit, linkedin ads
- building owned audiences (email, community)

here's the uncomfortable truth:

performance marketing in 2026 looks nothing like 2024.

the brands that adapt in the next 6 months will dominate.

the ones that don't will keep wondering why their cpa keeps climbing.

### Post 2: Wednesday, Feb 5 - "LinkedIn Outreach That Actually Works"
**Format:** Educational post (short form)
**Topic:** Message templates, psychology of replies
**Engagement Goal:** 30+ comments, 150+ likes

**Post Text:**
```
spent 2 hours analyzing 500+ cold linkedin messages.

found patterns in what gets replies vs what gets ignored.

the difference? surprisingly simple.

most linkedin outreach follows this template:

"hi [name], saw your post about [topic]. love your work! i help companies like yours [vague pitch]. interested in chatting?"

response rate: ~2%

here's what actually works 👇

the messages that get 30%+ reply rates all do 3 things:

1/ specific observation
not "love your content" but "your thread on geo yesterday mentioned authority signals - have you tested schema markup for this?"

2/ give before asking
"here's a framework we use for [their pain point]. thought you might find it useful. no strings attached."

3/ low-friction next step
not "can we schedule a call?" but "curious if you've seen this trend - what's your take?"

here's the psychology:

people don't ignore messages because they're busy.

they ignore them because there's no clear value and high perceived commitment.

when you:
• prove you actually understand their work
• offer something useful first
• make replying easy (just a quick thought)

suddenly you're not spam. you're a peer.

i tested this with 200 messages last month:

old approach: 
• 200 sent
• 4 replies
• 0 meetings
• 2% response rate

new approach:
• 200 sent
• 67 replies
• 12 meetings booked
• 33.5% response rate

same audience. same offer. different message.

the playbook:

➡️ spend 3 minutes researching their actual work
➡️ reference something specific (recent post, article, project)
➡️ share a resource/insight relevant to that thing
➡️ ask a simple question they can answer in 30 seconds
➡️ never pitch in the first message

this works because it's not a hack.

it's just... being a human who provides value.

try it this week. let me know what happens.
```

**CTA:** Ask what objections they face
**Expected Duration:** 10 min to post and monitor

### Post 3: Friday, Feb 7 - "The ROI Calculator That Changed Everything"
**Format:** Case study (short form)
**Topic:** Lead quality improvement through self-qualification
**Engagement Goal:** 40+ comments, 180+ likes

**Post Text:**
```
one tool multiplied our lead quality by 400%.

not exaggerating. here's how:

we built an roi calculator for our website.

not a generic "enter your revenue" thing.

a hyper-specific calculator that shows exactly what our solution is worth to that particular business.

before the calculator:
• 200 leads/month
• 8% qualified rate
• 16 sales conversations
• 3 deals closed

after the calculator:
• 180 leads/month (slightly fewer)
• 32% qualified rate (4x higher)
• 58 sales conversations
• 14 deals closed

what changed? intent.

people playing with the calculator are self-qualifying.

they're entering their real numbers.

they're seeing their actual potential roi.

by the time they book a call, they're 80% sold.

here's what makes a calculator convert:

1/ specific inputs
- not "annual revenue" but "current cac, average deal size, sales cycle length"
- the more specific, the more real it feels

2/ visual output
- charts that show current state vs potential state
- dollar amounts that make the opportunity tangible
- time frames that create urgency

3/ strategic placement
- we gate it after they see initial results
- email capture = "send me detailed breakdown"
- instant delivery builds trust

the template we use:

> "you're spending $X to acquire each customer"
> "with optimized [solution], that drops to $Y"
> "over 12 months, that's $Z in savings"
> "enter your email to see the full breakdown"

why this works so well:

traditional lead magnets (ebooks, guides, checklists) are passive.

calculators are active. they require input. they create ownership.

when someone types in their numbers and sees "u$847k potential savings", they've just convinced themselves.

you didn't pitch them. they sold themselves.

we built ours in 2 days using typeform + make.com.

no custom code. no dev team.

if you're in b2b or high-ticket, this is probably the highest-roi thing you can build this quarter.

**CTA:** Ask if they use lead qualification tools
**Expected Duration:** 10 min to post and monitor
